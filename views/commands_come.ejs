  <h1>Training: Come</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Build Positive Association with Your Voice</strong><br>
      Say your puppy’s name and “Come!” in a happy tone. Reward heavily—even for short distances. Start indoors.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use the “Touch” Game</strong><br>
      Say “Touch!” and reward when your puppy bumps your palm. Begin pairing with “Come!”.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Practice Short Distances Indoors</strong><br>
      Use 5–10 ft setups with treats and celebration. Add collar hold before reward.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use a Long Line Outside</strong><br>
      Use a 15–30 ft leash. Call “Puppy, come!” and reel gently if needed. Jackpot rewards when they arrive.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Add Distractions Gradually</strong><br>
      Practice around toys or people. Reward generously when recall succeeds.
    </li>
  </ol>
