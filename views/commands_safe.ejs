  <h1>Training: Safe</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1: Set Up the Position</strong><br>
      Sit or stand with your legs slightly apart. Lure your puppy between your legs with a treat. Mark (“Yes!”) and reward when they enter.
      <br>🔁 Repeat until confident.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 2: Encourage the Sit</strong><br>
      Once between your legs, lure their nose upward to encourage a sit. Mark and treat as soon as they sit calmly.
      <br>🔁 Repeat 5–10 times, rewarding while they remain calm in position.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 3: Add the Cue: “Safe”</strong><br>
      When they begin entering on their own, say “Safe” just as they move into place. Reward both entry and calm sitting.
      <br>🎯 Goal: Puppy hears “Safe,” enters between your legs, and sits calmly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 4: Practice in Different Contexts</strong><br>
      Try at home, in a chair, at the park. Begin in calm areas and gradually introduce distractions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 5: Use It as a Calming Cue</strong><br>
      Use “Safe” when your puppy is anxious or overstimulated. Reinforce with calm praise or petting.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Use high-value treats like chicken or cheese</li>
    <li>✅ Reward calm sitting, not just entry</li>
    <li>✅ Great for vet visits, sidewalks, pet stores</li>
    <li>✅ Add a release cue like “Free” or “OK”</li>
    <li>✅ Keep it positive—this is a comfort cue, not a command</li>
  </ul>
