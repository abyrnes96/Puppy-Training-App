  <h1>Potty Training</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Set a Predictable Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Take your puppy outside after waking, eating, playing, and every 1–2 hours.</li>
      <li>Stick to a consistent daily routine to build habits.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Use a Designated Potty Spot</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always go to the same outdoor spot.</li>
      <li>Say a cue like <strong>“Go potty”</strong> to help them associate the area with the behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Keep Potty Time Boring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a short leash and stay quiet — no playing, praise, or wandering yet.</li>
      <li>Limit the area to minimize distractions and keep them focused.</li>
      <li>Give them 5–10 minutes to go.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Reward Immediately</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a marker like <strong>“Yes!”</strong> and give a treat <em>within 1–2 seconds</em> of finishing.</li>
      <li>Reward outside, not once you're back indoors — timing is critical!</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Use the Crate Strategically</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the crate after potty breaks, during naps, and when you can't supervise.</li>
      <li>Also use it after <em>unsuccessful</em> potty trips — try again in 15 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Supervise Constantly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch for signs like sniffing, circling, or wandering away.</li>
      <li>Keep them within sight using gates or a leash tethered to you.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Clean Accidents Thoroughly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use an enzymatic cleaner to fully remove scent (ordinary cleaners won't work).</li>
      <li>This helps prevent your puppy from returning to the same spot.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Be Patient & Consistent</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It can take 2–4 weeks of repetition for potty training to stick.</li>
      <li>Never punish accidents — just calmly clean and refocus on what works.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>✅ Extra Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep a potty log to track timing and patterns.</li>
      <li>Use a consistent cue like <strong>“Go potty”</strong> to speed learning.</li>
      <li>Never punish — accidents are part of learning.</li>
      <li>Reward calm outdoor behavior even when not going.</li>
      <li>Gradually increase time between potty breaks as your puppy grows.</li>
    </ul>
