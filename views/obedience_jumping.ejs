  <h1>No Jumping / Calm Greetings</h1>

  <h3>🚫 Stopping Jumping Up</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Ignore the Jump:</strong> Turn away silently. Reward only when four paws are down.</li>
    <li><strong>Reward Calm:</strong> Treat the moment they sit or stay grounded. Keep rewards ready.</li>
    <li><strong>Preempt with a Cue:</strong> Ask for “Sit” or “Place” before anyone approaches.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Leash:</strong> Step on the leash if needed to manage energy and guide sitting.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>👋 Calm Greetings with People</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Train Visitors:</strong> Have guests ignore jumping. Wait for calm before saying hello.</li>
    <li><strong>Reward Calm During Approach:</strong> Use a sit to anchor. Break the sit = greeting goes away.</li>
    <li><strong>Greet and Retreat:</strong> Person leaves if pup jumps, returns if calm.</li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ Use “Say hi!” as a release for greeting</li>
    <li>✅ Use a mat or place for calm greetings</li>
    <li>✅ Be consistent—don’t allow “just this once”</li>
  </ul>
