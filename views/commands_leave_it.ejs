  <h1>Training: Leave It</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start with “Leave It” in Your Hand</strong><br>
      Hold a treat in your closed fist and say “Leave it.” Ignore sniffing or pawing. Say “Yes!” and reward with a different treat when your pup backs off or looks away.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Progress to Open Hand</strong><br>
      Hold the treat in an open palm. Say “Leave it.” Close your hand if they try to grab. Only reward restraint (looking away or waiting).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Move to Floor Practice</strong><br>
      Place a treat on the floor and cover it with your foot. Say “Leave it.” Reward from your other hand when your pup backs off. Slowly uncover as they improve.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use Real-Life Objects</strong><br>
      Practice with tempting things: toys, food, trash, or shoes. Use a leash to prevent lunging. Reward for ignoring or checking in with you.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Use a different reward than the item they’re told to leave</li>
    <li>✅ Never let them “win” the forbidden item</li>
    <li>✅ Keep sessions short and daily</li>
    <li>✅ Stay calm and upbeat—“Leave it” is a game, not a punishment</li>
  </ul>
