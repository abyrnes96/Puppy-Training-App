  <h1>Training: Place / Freedom</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Introduce the “Place” Spot</strong><br>
      Choose a bed, mat, or cot. Lure your puppy onto it. Say “Yes!” and reward when all four paws are on.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Add the Cue: “Place”</strong><br>
      Once your pup starts stepping onto the mat consistently, say “Place” just before they move on. Repeat short sessions daily.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Build Duration Slowly</strong><br>
      Reward staying for 1–3 seconds, then extend to 5, 10, 30 seconds. Calmly return them if they step off.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Add Distance & Distractions</strong><br>
      Step away, toss a toy, or walk past. Reward for staying on. Use a leash early on if needed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Introduce “Freedom” (Release Word)</strong><br>
      Use a release cue like “OK” or “Free.” Encourage them off the mat calmly. Only release when they’re settled.
    </li>
  </ol>
