  <h1>Crate Training</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduce the Crate Positively</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Leave the crate door open and let your puppy explore on their own.</li>
      <li>Toss treats or toys inside to build curiosity and comfort.</li>
      <li>Feed meals in the crate so your puppy associates it with something good.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Add a Crate Cue</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Say a cue like <strong>“Crate”</strong> or <strong>“Go to bed”</strong> as your puppy enters.</li>
      <li>Use a marker word or clicker, then give a treat once they’re inside.</li>
      <li>Never force your puppy into the crate—encourage and reward voluntary entry.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Use Chew Toys for Calm Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Offer a <strong>frozen Kong</strong>, <strong>Nylabone</strong>, or <strong>Toppl</strong> during crate time.</li>
      <li>This helps your puppy learn the crate is a relaxing place, not just confinement.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Keep Sessions Short at First</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with 5–10 minutes while you’re in the same room.</li>
      <li>Gradually increase crate time and include short out-of-sight moments.</li>
      <li>Always return calmly and reward quiet, calm behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Crate for Naps & Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Crate your puppy after potty breaks, meals, and play sessions.</li>
      <li>Use it to build a nap routine so your puppy sees it as their resting zone.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Don’t Use the Crate as Punishment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The crate should always feel safe, never scary or negative.</li>
      <li>Avoid locking your puppy inside if they're distressed or barking—work calmly through those behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>✅ Extra Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the crate in a calm, low-traffic area of your home.</li>
      <li>Use a consistent entry cue and a release word like <strong>“Freedom”</strong>.</li>
      <li>Cover part of the crate with a blanket to create coziness (ensure airflow and safety).</li>
      <li>If your puppy is whining, wait for a quiet moment before opening the door.</li>
      <li>Be consistent—dogs thrive on predictable routines.</li>
    </ul>
